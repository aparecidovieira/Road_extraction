# Road_extraction
Attention Unet and Deep Unet implementation for road extraction using multi-gpu model tensorflow

Several variations of Deep U-Net were tested with extra layers and extra convolutions. Nevertheless, the model that outperformed all of them was the Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas. I have added an extra tweak improving even further performance, switching the convolution blocks to the residual blocks

# TensorFlow Segmentation
TF segmentation models, U-Net, Attention Unet, Deep U-Net (All variations of U-Net)

Image Segmentation using neural networks (NNs), designed for extracting the road network from remote sensing imagery and it can be used in other applications labels every pixel in the image (Semantic segmentation)
